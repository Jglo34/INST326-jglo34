Week 2
This week I used AI to research the new iPhones and the latest iOS 26 update. Since I work closely with Apple devices in a customer-facing role, I wanted to learn more about the new features so I could talk about them more confidently and effectively with customers. I asked ChatGPT to break down the updates in a way that I could easily explain and also make the features sound more exciting when recommending the phones. This helped me become more knowledgeable and better prepared to answer questions or spark interest when someone is thinking about upgrading.

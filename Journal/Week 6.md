Week 6
This week I used AI to research the ongoing controversy around AI-generated music artists, specifically focusing on the case of Xania Monet. I had seen discussions about SZA and other artists reacting to AI-created music, and I wanted to understand what the debate was really about. Using ChatGPT, I learned that Xania Monet is an AI-generated R&B artist created by Mississippi-based poet Telisha “Nikki” Jones using a generative platform called Suno. Her music gained serious traction — with one of her songs hitting No. 1 on the R&B Digital Song Sales chart — and she reportedly signed a $3 million deal with Hallwood Media.
The AI helped me break down why this is controversial: artists like SZA and Kehlani have raised concerns about fairness, creativity, and what it means for human musicians when AI-generated content starts dominating the charts. It also helped me understand the ethical and copyright questions surrounding generative tools like Suno. This research gave me a more nuanced understanding of how AI intersects with creativity, intellectual property, and the future of the music industry.
Here’s the AI chat I used:

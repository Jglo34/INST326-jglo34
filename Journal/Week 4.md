Week 4
This week I used AI to help me understand and write about the impact of systems—specifically the chronosystem and macrosystem—on students with disabilities. I needed to analyze how current events, social movements, and policy changes can influence educational outcomes for these students. ChatGPT helped me break down complex ideas like inclusive legislation, federal initiatives, social movements such as #NothingAboutUsWithoutUs, and how political or economic shifts can both help and harm special education. It also helped me explore how post-pandemic digital learning affects students with disabilities over time. AI was especially useful in helping me summarize and explain these systems-level effects in a clear, informed way for my assignment.
Here’s the shared AI chat I used:

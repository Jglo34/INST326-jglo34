Week 1
This week I used AI while working on a SQL assignment. I was having trouble getting my query right, and I kept running into errors, especially with things like query syntax and formatting. I used ChatGPT to help me figure out what I was doing wrong it gave me explanations and corrected my mistakes. I also used Claude to double check my query and compare the responses between both models. I didnâ€™t use AI to directly write the whole assignment, but I did use it for debugging, explanations, and learning from the errors I was making. It really helped me understand where I was going wrong and how to fix it.

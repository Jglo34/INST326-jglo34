Week 5
This week I used AI to dive deeper into the Gen V universe, specifically to understand Marie Moreau’s powers and her potential connection to Homelander. In the latest episode, it was hinted that she and Homelander might be cousins and that she could be more powerful than him. I used AI to verify and explore that claim — here’s the link to the conversation:

AI helped break down the lore behind Project Odessa, which connects both Marie and Homelander as engineered supes. It also explained Marie’s unique power set — her ability to manipulate blood, potentially heal or resurrect, and even control biological systems beyond hemokinesis. I learned that her versatility, growth potential, and narrative setup make her a serious threat in-universe, possibly even surpassing Homelander’s brute strength. Using AI gave me a much more nuanced and layered understanding of her character and how she’s being positioned in the show.
